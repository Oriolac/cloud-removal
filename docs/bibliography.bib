	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires
	many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network
	and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use
	the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of
	a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that
	enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained
	end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a
	sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of
	neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network
	trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won
	the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin.
	Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than
	a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the
	trained networks are available at

We describe a simple approach for this task based on a transformer that autoregressively models the text and image tokens as a single stream of data. With sufficient data and scale, our approach is competitive with previous domain-specific models when evaluated in a zero-shot fashion.}

The aim of this research is to super-resolve the lower-resolution (20 m and 60 m Ground Sampling Distance – GSD) bands to 10 m GSD, so as to obtain a complete data cube at the maximal sensor resolution. We employ a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform end-to-end upsampling, which is trained with data at lower resolution, i.e., from 40 → 20 m, respectively 360 → 60 m GSD. In this way, one has access to a virtually infinite amount of training data, by downsampling real Sentinel-2 images. We use data sampled globally over a wide range of geographical locations, to obtain a network that generalises across different climate zones and land-cover types, and can super-resolve arbitrary Sentinel-2 images without the need of retraining. In quantitative evaluations (at lower scale, where ground truth is available), our network, which we call DSen2, outperforms the best competing approach by almost 50% in RMSE, while better preserving the spectral characteristics. It also delivers visually convincing results at the full 10 m GSD.}

	ABSTRACT = {Cloud cover remains a significant limitation to a broad range of applications relying on optical remote sensing imagery, including crop identification/yield prediction, climate monitoring, and land cover classification. A common approach to cloud removal treats the problem as an inpainting task and imputes optical data in the cloud-affected regions employing either mosaicing historical data or making use of sensing modalities not impacted by cloud obstructions, such as SAR. Recently, deep learning approaches have been explored in these applications; however, the majority of reported solutions rely on external learning practices, i.e., models trained on fixed datasets. Although these models perform well within the context of a particular dataset, a significant risk of spatial and temporal overfitting exists when applied in different locations or at different times. Here, cloud removal was implemented within an internal learning regime through an inpainting technique based on the deep image prior. The approach was evaluated on both a synthetic  with an exact ground truth, as well as real samples. The ability to inpaint the cloud-affected regions for varying weather conditions across a whole year with no prior training was demonstrated, and the performance of the approach was characterised.},
